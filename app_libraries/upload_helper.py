        Meant for SINGLE-file uploads.

        It accepts a flask.request object, and it creates a file from the upload,
        which it stores into the folder specified by upload_dir

        It decides, from the name of the file being uploaded, a meaningful (and safe) name
        for the temporary file to create as part of the upload.

        It returns both the basename and the full filename of the temporary file thus created,
        as well as the original name of the file.

        In case of error, an Exception is raised
