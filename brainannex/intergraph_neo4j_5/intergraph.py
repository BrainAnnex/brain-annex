    IMPORTANT : for versions 5.26 of the Neo4j database

    A thin wrapper around the Neo4j python connectivity library "Neo4j Python Driver",
    which is documented at: https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/4.4/index.html

    This "CORE" library allows the execution of arbitrary Cypher (query language) commands,
    and helps manage the complex data structures that they return.
    It may be used independently,
    or as the foundation of the higher-level child class, "NeoAccess"

        """
        Run a Cypher query.  Best suited for Cypher queries that return individual values,
        but may also be used with queries that return nodes or relationships or paths - or nothing.

        Execute the query and fetch the returned values as a list of dictionaries.
        In cases of no results, return an empty list.
        A new session to the database driver is started, and then immediately terminated after running the query.

        ALTERNATIVES:
            * if the Cypher query returns nodes, and one wants to extract the internal Neo4j ID's or labels
              (in addition to all the properties and their values) then use query_extended() instead.

            * in case of queries that alter the database (and may or may not return values),
              use update_query() instead, in order to retrieve information about the effects of the operation

        :param q:               A string with a Cypher query
        :param data_binding:    An optional Cypher dictionary
                                EXAMPLE, assuming that the cypher string contains the substrings "$node_id":
                                        {'node_id': 20}

        :param single_row:      (OPTIONAL) If True, return a dictionary containing just the first (0-th) result row, if present,
                                    or None in case of no results.
                                    Note that if the query returns multiple records, the picked one
                                    will be arbitrary, unless an ORDER BY is included in the query
                                    EXAMPLES of returned values:
                                        {"brand": "Toyota", "color": "White"}
                                        {'n': {}}

        :param single_cell:     (OPTIONAL) Meant for situations where only 1 node (record) is expected,
                                    and one wants only 1 specific field of that record.
                                    If a string is provided, return the value of the field by that name
                                    in the first (0-th) retrieved record.
                                    In case of no nodes found, or a node that lacks a key with this name, None will be returned.
                                    Note that if the query returns multiple records, the picked one
                                    will be arbitrary, unless an ORDER BY is included in the query

        :param single_column:   (OPTIONAL) Name of the column of interest.
                                If provided, assemble a list (possibly empty)
                                from all the values of that particular column all records.
                                Note: can also be used to extract data from a particular node, for queries that return whole nodes

        :return:        If any of single_row, single_cell or single_column are True, see info under their entries.
                        If those arguments are all False, it returns a (possibly empty) list of dictionaries.
                        Each dictionary in the list will depend on the nature of the Cypher query.
                        EXAMPLES:
                            Cypher returns nodes (after finding or creating them): RETURN n1, n2
                                    -> list item such as {'n1': {'gender': 'M', 'patient_id': 123}
                                                          'n2': {'gender': 'F', 'patient_id': 444}}
                            Cypher returns attribute values that get renamed: RETURN n.gender AS client_gender, n.pid AS client_id
                                    -> list items such as {'client_gender': 'M', 'client_id': 123}
                            Cypher returns attribute values without renaming them: RETURN n.gender, n.pid
                                    -> list items such as {'n.gender': 'M', 'n.pid': 123}
                            Cypher returns a single computed value
                                    -> a single list item such as {"count(n)": 100}
                            Cypher returns RELATIONSHIPS (LINKS), with or without properties: MERGE (c)-[r :PAID_BY]->(p)
                                    -> a single list item such as [{ 'r': ({}, 'PAID_BY', {}) }]   NOTE: link properties are NOT returned
                            Cypher returns a path:   MATCH p= .......   RETURN p
                                    -> list item such as {'p': [ {'name': 'Eve'}, 'LOVES', {'name': 'Adam'} ] }
                            Cypher creates nodes (without returning them)

        For example, useful in scenarios where nodes were returned,
        and their internal database IDs and/or labels are desired
        (in addition to all the properties and their values)

        Unless the flatten flag is True, individual records are kept as separate lists.
            For example, "MATCH (b:boat), (c:car) RETURN b, c"
