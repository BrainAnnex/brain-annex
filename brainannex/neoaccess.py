    HISTORY and AUTHORS:
        - NeoAccess (this library) is a fork of NeoInterface;
                NeoAccess was created, and is being maintained, by Julian West,
                primarily in the context of the BrainAnnex.org open-source project.
                It started out in late 2021; for change log,
                see the "LIBRARIES" entries in https://brainannex.org/history

        - NeoInterface (the parent library)
                was co-authored by Alexey Kuznetsov and Julian West in 2021,
                and is maintained by GSK pharmaceuticals
                with an Apache License 2.0 (https://github.com/GSK-Biostatistics/neointerface).
                NeoInterface is in part based on the earlier library Neo4jLiaison,
                as well as a library developed by Alexey Kuznetsov.

        - Neo4jLiaison, an ancestor library now obsoleted, was authored by Julian West in 2020

    IMPORTANT : this works with various versions of the Neo4j database (and, possibly,

    High-level class to interface with the Neo4j graph database from Python.

    This class is a layer above its base class "InterGraph" (which is database-specific)
        and it provides a higher-level functionality for common database operations,

        Return a "NodeSpecs" object storing all the passed specifications (the "RAW match structure"),
        as expected as argument in various other functions in this library,
        in order to identify a node or group of nodes.

        IMPORTANT:  if internal_id is provided, all other conditions are DISREGARDED;
                    otherwise, an implicit AND applies to all the specified conditions.

        Note:   NO database operation is actually performed by this function.

        [Other names explored: identify(), preserve(), define_match(), locate(), choose() or identify()]

        ALL THE ARGUMENTS ARE OPTIONAL (no arguments at all means "match everything in the database")
        :param labels:      A string (or list/tuple of strings) specifying one or more Neo4j labels.
                                (Note: blank spaces ARE allowed in the strings)
                                EXAMPLES:  "cars"
                                            ("cars", "powered vehicles")
                            Note that if multiple labels are given, then only nodes with ALL of them will be matched;
                            at present, there's no way to request an "OR" operation

        :param internal_id: An integer with the node's internal database ID.
                                If specified, it OVER-RIDES all the remaining arguments [except for the labels (TODO: revisit this)]

        :param key_name:    A string with the name of a node attribute; if provided, key_value must be present, too
        :param key_value:   The required value for the above key; if provided, key_name must be present, too
                                Note: no requirement for the key to be primary

        :param properties:  A (possibly-empty) dictionary of property key/values pairs, indicating a condition to match.
                                EXAMPLE: {"gender": "F", "age": 22}

        :param clause:      Either None, OR a (possibly empty) string containing a Cypher subquery,
                            OR a pair/list (string, dict) containing a Cypher subquery and the data-binding dictionary for it.
                            The Cypher subquery should refer to the node using the assigned dummy_node_name (by default, "n")
                                IMPORTANT:  in the dictionary, don't use keys of the form "n_par_i",
                                            where n is the dummy node name and i is an integer,
                                            or an Exception will be raised - those names are for internal use only
                                EXAMPLES:   "n.age < 25 AND n.income > 100000"
                                            ("n.weight < $max_weight", {"max_weight": 100})

        :param dummy_node_name: A string with a name by which to refer to the node (by default, "n");
                                only used if a `clause` argument is passed

        :return:            A python data dictionary, to preserve together all the passed arguments

        Export the entire Neo4j database as a JSON string.

        IMPORTANT: APOC must be activated in the database, to use this function.
                   Otherwise it'll raise an Exception.
                   Different versions of the Neo4j 4.4 database return different values for the dicts with type "relationship" !!!
                        In the dicts for the "start" and "end" nodes, sometime the "properties" are included, and sometimes not!!!

        EXAMPLE:
        { 'nodes': 2,
          'relationships': 1,
          'properties': 6,
          'data': '[{"type":"node","id":"3","labels":["User"],"properties":{"name":"Adam","age":32,"male":true}},\n
                    {"type":"node","id":"4","labels":["User"],"properties":{"name":"Eve","age":18}},\n

                   ]'
