{#  Flask-passed parameters:
        header_title:   Text to display on this status bar

    Horizontal status bar, also including a link to scroll to the page's top

    HOW TO USE: site pages that want to include this Horizontal status bar
                need to have the line
                {% include "horiz_status_bar.htm" %}
                and also have the Flask-passed parameters:  header_title

                Adjust the corresponding CSS file (horiz_status_bar.css) as needed
                (for example, to display this status bar as a fixed element at the top)
